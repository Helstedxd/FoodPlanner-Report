\section{Paper Prototyping}\label{Sketches}
This section includes the processes of Envisionment, evaluation and prototyping. The prototype will be paper prototype which means it will consist of paper sketches depicting how the visual appearence of the program will be. These sketches are fundamental ideas for the program but they can and mostl ikely will be changed when the program moves into the development phase.

The navigation between the different windows of the program is done by using a bar in the bottom of the screen. This bar is always visible making it possible for the user to quickly select any of the main screens to navigate to. The bar is shown \cref{NavigationBarSketch}.

\subsection{Navigation bar}

The navigation bar is placed in the bottom of the program, on every screen. This requires quite a large amount of space, and if the screen of the device on which the program is shown is small, the user will not have a lot of space to show the rest of the screen, therefore it has been chosen that the bar will disappear when not active.

When the user hovers over the bar, it will appear, whereas if the user does not use the navigation bar it will disappear, and only a line will be shown, so the user know that it is hidden in the bottom.

The navigation bar itself, consist of 5 element/buttons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Meal plan
    \item Recipe
    \item Shopping list
    \item Inventory
    \item Settings
\end{itemize}

Each of the buttons take the user to the screen which it represent, and all of these screen will be described later on. The icons which are used in the representation are just for the design progress, and not necessarily the final ones.

All of the sketches, are just temporary ideas, and might be changed when they are made.
