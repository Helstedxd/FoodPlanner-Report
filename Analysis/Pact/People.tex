\subsubsection{People who want to save time when making and planning cooking and doing the groceries}

\subsubsection{Comparison}
It is common for all the described people that they could save time and/or money by planning their grocery-shopping and meals. A system would have to be fast and easy to use, so that the time spent planning does not exceed the time it would normally take. The system should automate tasks for the user, for example by recommending recipes and keeping track of what food they already have at home. It must be very easy for the user to input the groceries, and not become a burden, preferably this should be fully automated, for example by adding groceries from a shopping list that a user used when shopping, or semi-automated by allowing the use to scan the product barcode.\fxnote{Nogle af de krav der bliver nævnt her kommer ud af den blå luft."The system should automate tasks for the user..."
