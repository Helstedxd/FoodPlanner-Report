\chapter{Design Conclusion}
In \nameref{ScenarioBasedDesign} the interaction design of the program was defined. This was done by using the Scenario-Based model from the Design and Evaluation of User Interfaces course. This model used real world experiences of users as \nameref{UserStories} and from these conceptual and \nameref{ConcreteScenarios} was created. The concrete scenarios was use to develop a paper prototype. The conceptual scenarios and User stories was processed to produce requirements and scenario corpus which was then used to define a conceptual model. The Paper prototypes and the conceptual model were then combined to formulate the design language for the program. The design language defined a standard for the interaction design of the program.
