\section{Domains}

Domains are important to look at to be able to make the best possible design for the interface of the system. Domain is defined as the different aspects of the program, and both large and small domains will be described.

\subsection{Planning}

Planning is the largest domain of the project, as the software developed is focused on planning a meal plan and a shopping list. Planning is the primary aspect of the project, as the analysis has concluded that food waste can be reduced by planning meals ahead.

\subsection{Grocery shopping}

Grocery shopping is one of the small domains, as the shopping itself is not something that the software takes into consideration. The software generates a shopping list that the user has to follow, as this reduce impulse purchases, as the analysis has shown that having a shopping list does this.

\subsection{Cooking}

Cooking is another one of the small domains. The software gives the user a recipe, where in the information can be changed depending on how many are going to be eating the meal.

\subsection{Food inventory administration}
 
The last domain of the project is food inventory administration. The software is keeping track of the inventory of the user, so the user can have an easy overview of what is present in the home, but also to be able to calculate that needs to be bought to be able to cook the recipes that are on the meal plan.
