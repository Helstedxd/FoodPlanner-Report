This chapter will first document the pages of the program. These pages have been programmed using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), which is a part of the .NET framework. WPF is developed by Microsoft and uses eXtensible Application Markup Language (XAML), which is based on XML, to program the user interface of an application. WPF is well suited for applications which uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) structure because it only controls the view of an application. The program that this project develops is meant to be a phone application. The user interface therefore has a set size resembling a smartphone and the interface elements are programmed to look and work as they would on a smartphone. The chapter will then continue to document the custom user controls in the program. User controls are used because they make it possible to define the control and behavior of an interface element.
