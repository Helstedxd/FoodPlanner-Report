\section{Food helper definition}
The IT-system is primarily a planning program which lets you plan your meals in advance based on what is in your inventory to assist the user and reduce food waste. Secondarily the program will allow administration of a meal plan and inventory and incorporate functions to alter this plan and inventory by adding or removing recipes and groceries. The system will be designed for tablets and smartphones because these devices offers mobility and thereby available both in and out of the user’s home.
