\subsection{Design Requirements} \label{DesignRequirements}
When analyzing the interviews in \cref{InterviewAnalysis}, conceptual scenarios in \cref{conceptualScenarios} as well as the PACT analysis in \cref{PACTAnalysis}, lastly also personas, which can be found in \cref{PersonasAppendix}, some design requirements are discovered.\fxnote{Split text here, so its not that much text on the same.} These requirements have been listed in the appendix, \cref{RequirementsAppendix} and are later included in the definition of a scenario corpus. Furthermore the long list of requirements have been sorted into the same domains as can be found in scenario corpus, \cref{ScenarioCorpus}, but also includes a list of more general requirements followed by a list to requirement actions, as well as a limited list of technologies, which can be used. Some Requirements can be placed in more than one domain, but is only be listed in the domain that seems most ideal.
