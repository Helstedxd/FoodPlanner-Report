\section{Meal schedule}

The two figures in this section \cref{MealScheduleList} and \cref{MealScheduleBar} displays two design ideas for the meal schedule aspect of the program.

	\label{MealScheduleList}
\end{figure}

Beginning with the screen to the left on \cref{MealScheduleList} there are three areas of concern. On the bottom we have the navigation screen which is displayed throughout the program. In the middle of the screen there is a list overview of 7 days. Each day shows the names of scheduled meals on that specific day. If there are many meals scheduled the list will expand to outside of the screen view. The user can swipe to view all days and press a specific day to view details about it. This method of display gives the user an easy and informative view of the week days.
