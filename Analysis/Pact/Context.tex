\section{Context}
In this section we look at the context in which certain activities are performed.

\subsection{Physical environment}
Using the program in different locations will have different impact on the user experience. Having the program on a device set some limitations, as the user will have to interact with the program, during different situations.
\begin{itemize}
\item When a user is at home, there is time to update the foodplan and look through different recipes.
\item While shopping, one hand must be free, to check which items that has been put in the basket, and what else must be bought.
\item While cooking at home, an ingredients list could be revisited, or a cooking guide will have to be followed, with greasy hands this kind of interaction will be difficult.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Social context}
The program can be used in different social context.
\begin{itemize}
\item If more than one person share the same food plan, they must both have access to the program, and if it is handled on their personal devices, synchronization is necessary.
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Organizational context}
\fxnote{According to DEB there is also an organizational context, but i can't fit it into this context. Me neither lol - I don't think we need to include it.}
