\section{System}
This section formulates the system definition. This is done by first writing a FACTOR criteria and then using this to formulate the system definition. The system definition is a description of a computerized system in a natural language. The system definition is used to describe the characteristics of a system.
\subsection{Definition (FACTOR)}
To formulate a system definition the FACTOR\cite{OOAD_BATOF} criteria was used to establish important parts of the system.

\begin{description}
	\item[Functionality] Help users organise a meal plan based on their preferences and inventory. Administrate settings, inventory and meal plan.
	\item[Application domain] System maintenance staff and users planning meals.
	\item[Conditions] The system will be used by users with varying technical abilities and cooking experience.
	\item[Technology] Tablet, smartphone.
	\item[Objects] User, inventory, recipe, ingredients.
	\item[Responsibility] An administrative/planning tool.
\end{description}

\subsection{System Definition}
The system primarily makes it possible to plan meals in advance, based on what is in a users inventory to assist a user and reduce food waste.
Secondarily the program will allow administration of a meal plan and inventory, and incorporate functions to alter these by adding or removing recipes and groceries. The system maintenance staff will make sure that the system is operating correctly.
The system will be designed for tablets and smartphones, as these devices offers mobility and thereby are available both inside and outside of the user's home.
