\section{State of the Art}
In this section, the current IT-systems will be described and what other systems that can be used to plan what food to eat.

Some of the technologies that is currently being used to make a food plan could be an mobile application called Food Planner.
In this application the users can plan meals ahead of time, lookup recipes, look at what groceries that needs to be bought,
list what the user have in the fridge so the grocery list appends to the items in the fridge and more.
