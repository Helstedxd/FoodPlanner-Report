\subsection{Concrete Scenarios}\label{ConcreteScenarios}
This section will use the process of specifying design constraints of the conceptual scenarios in \cref{conceptualScenarios} and produce a number of concrete scenarios. Each concrete scenario has a PACT overview followed by a detailed scenario description, where notes are marked by a set of parentheses, with roman numerals, e.g. (I), these notes are then listed below the scenario, and explained when in the scenario, different design choices can be made.

\subsubsection{Concrete Scenario 1: Shopping without a written list.}\label{ConcreteScenario1}

\emph{PACT overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{People:} Peter, works at a bank office.
\item \textbf{Activities:} Selecting a meal, creating a shopping list and updating inventory.  
\item \textbf{Context:} In a car and in the local supermarket.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Introduction:} Peter is on his way to the local grocery store. On the way he thinks of what he wants for dinner and from this he assembles a list of ingredients that he needs to buy. When he walks around the store picking each item he imagines crossing it off a list. On his walk around the store he picks up a few extra items that he thinks are needed at home.

\emph{Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Peter has just gotten of work and is on his way home in his car. While he drives through traffic he thinks of what meal he wants to eat. He is visited by his sister Laura and her boyfriend John, so he wants to make a good meal that requires good and fresh ingredients. He knows that Laura likes chicken(I). Peter therefore decides to buy a large chicken and ingredients for a salad. 
\item In the store Peter starts by walking over to the vegetable area and begins to check off what he needs to make a good salad(II). He is insecure of what he has at home so he buys all of the ingredients just to be sure(III). He now glances over the vegetables on the shelves and feels like taking a few apples(IV). He Looks down into his basket and checks what he has gotten so far, which is enough for a salad and a few apples for the next days.
\item Peter now goes directly over to the frozen products and picks out a chicken. Looking over the groceries he decides to also buy food for tomorrow(V). He picks up a bag of frozen potatoes and some steaks. He decides not to buy any more because he thinks there will be some leftovers from tonight's meal.  
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Design Notes}

\begin{enumerate} [(I)]
\item How does the program enable Peter to specify and find the right recipe that he wants?
\item Should the user cross off items on the shopping list or how is it indicated that an ingredient is bought?
\item  How does the program make is possible for users to see what items that they have at home so they avoid being in doubt?
\item Can the user add items via the shopping list or should they be added directly to the inventory?
\item How does the program ease the planning of a meal at any time e.g. by minimizing the number of steps to plan a meal?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Concrete Scenario 2: Forgetting to buy ingredients.}\label{ConcreteScenario2}

\emph{PACT overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{People:} Jenny, working as a teacher.
\item \textbf{Activities:} Shopping, checking shopping list and updating shopping list. 
\item \textbf{Context:} In a grocery store and in the home.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Introduction:} Jenny is out shopping for the next two days with her children. She wants to shop for lasagne and pizza. When she gets home after shopping she discovers that some ingredients are still missing. She drives back to the grocery store and buys the missing ingredients. 

\emph{Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Jenny is going to the grocery store with her two children James and Emily. She has not written a shopping list but she does know what meals to buy ingredients for. She wants to make lasagne this evening and tomorrow she and her children are going to make pizza together. 
\item In the store she walks around picking up items and checking them off of her list(I). She starts with buying the ingredients she needs for lasagne and then goes on to buy the ingredients to make pizza. Her children chose some ingredients they want to put on the pizzas(II) and they are put in the basket with everything else. After buying all the items(III) she can think of, for her planned meals, she and the children walk to the checkout. 
\item In the car on the way home Jenny talks with her children about their day. The children have been in the local sports center so they are very hungry tonight. Jenny quickly unloads the car as they arrive at home. In the kitchen she places the bought ingredients(IV). As she opens the refrigerator and puts in the new ingredients she sees that there is no cheese for the pizzas. She did not buy any when she was in the grocery store because she thought there were plenty at home(V). She tells her children to stay home and drives back to the grocery store.
\item In the store she goes directly to the dairy area and picks up the cheese she needs. Before she leaves for the check out she thinks of anything that could still be missing. She is not sure there are enough tomato sauce for the pizzas so she picks some extra cans. Now she is sure there is no more ingredients missing and walks up to the checkout. She pays for the ingredients and drives home to cook dinner with her children.  
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Design Notes}

\begin{enumerate} [(I)]
\item Should the user cross off items on the shopping list or how is it indicated that an ingredient is bought?  
\item Can the user add/edit recipes in the program with their own variants of the meal?
\item Should the user cross off items on the shopping list or how is it indicated that an ingredient is bought? 
\item Can the user add items via the shopping list or should they be added directly to the inventory?
\item How does the program make it possible for users to see what items they have at home so they avoid being in doubt?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Concrete Scenario 3: Receiving text messages to shop after.} \label{ConcreteScenario3}

\emph{PACT overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item People: Casper, taxi driver.  
\item Activities: Shopping and texting with his wife.
\item Context: In the grocery store.
\item Technology: Smartphone.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Introduction:} Casper is out shopping for the next couple of days. He does not have a full list of all the ingredients that is needed at home.

\item After collecting each ingredient on the list he walks up to the check out. Just before he gets in line his wife texts him and asks if he can get some rice. Luckily he is still in the supermarket so it is not a problem to get the rice.  
\item He gets the rice and now has everything that is needed at home. If there is still something missing, it will be bought next time he goes shopping.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Design notes}

\begin{enumerate} [(I)]
\item What information is shown to each ingredient on the list and how is it presented?
\item How would the user know what is missing at home if the wife could not check up on it?
\item How does the user add ingredients to the shopping list (add to shopping list or inventory)?
\item Should the user cross off items on the shopping list or how is it indicated that an ingredient is bought? 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Concrete Scenario 4} \label{ConcreteScenario4}

\emph{Title:} Sending text messages to shop after.

\emph{PACT overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item People: Olivia, Housewife.  
\item Activities: Checking inventory and making a shopping list.
\item Context: In the home.
\item Technology: Smartphone.  
\end{itemize}

\emph{Introduction:} Olivia is in her home when she gets a text from her husband asking if they are missing some ingredients. She looks at his list and checks if they have any of it at home. She also checks if there is anything not on the list that is needed. She texts her husband back with a few ingredients that he can add to his list.

\item After sitting down in front of her PC she remembers that they are getting guests tomorrow. They need some lunch to serve. She writes that the husband should also get some fish, fresh potatoes and fresh vegetables(III). She puts the phone away and starts working again. 
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Design notes}

\begin{enumerate} [(I)]
\item Should the user input anything else than name and quantity of the ingredient when adding it to the shopping list? 
\item Can multiple ingredients be added to the shopping list at the same time?  
\item Could the user pick a recipe and then the ingredients will be added to the shopping list?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Concrete Scenario 5} \label{ConcreteScenario5}

\emph{Title:} Shopping in multiple stores.

\emph{PACT overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item People: Dennis, train conductor. 
\item Activities: Shopping and editing Shopping list.
\item Context: In a grocery store.
\item Technology: Smartphone.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Introduction:} Dennis has a list of ingredients he needs to buy. He knows that on store will have a sale but the other ones will not. He decides to go to the store with the sale and buy all the ingredients he can get. All the ingredients that he cannot buy at the first store will be bought at another one.

\emph{Scenario}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Dennis has written a shopping list for the next four days(I). The list is quite long so he does not mind shopping in different stores or on two consecutive days. He can see in the sale magazines that one of the local grocery stores has a sale today. He decides to go there and buy as many of the ingredients from his list as he can(II). The rest of the ingredients will be bought in another store that he usually shops in.    
\item Later the same day he drives to the store with sales. He looks at his list and starts going around checking ingredients of the list(III). As he goes around he sees some sale offers that he just cannot resist and puts into his basket(IV). When he comes up to the check out counter he looks at his list and double checks that he has crossed of and added the extra ingredients. 
\item Dennis buys the ingredients(V) and heads home. At home he unpacks and makes a new list of the items he is missing. The day after he goes to another local store with the intentions to buy all the ingredients on his shopping list. He buys all the ingredients at the store without adding any impulse buys. He pays for the ingredients and drives home to cook some evening dinner.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Design notes}

\begin{enumerate} [(I)]
\item Can the user specify how many days to shop for?
\item How does the user "buy" some ingredients on the shopping list but not all.
\item Should the user cross off items on the shopping list or how is it indicated that an ingredient is bought?
\item Should the user input anything else than name and quantity of the ingredient when adding it to the shopping list?
\item How is it indicated that an ingredient is bought?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Concrete Scenario 6} \label{ConcreteScenario6}
