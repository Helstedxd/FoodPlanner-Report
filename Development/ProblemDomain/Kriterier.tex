\section{Priority of Criteria}

When designing a software based system, it is important to consider which criteria are needed for the system, and if some of the criteria are more important than others. The criteria will be organised in to \cref{CriteriaTable}, the importance of them range from very important to trivially fulfilled.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}\hline
Criteria        & Very important & Important & Less important & Irrelevant & Trivially fulfilled \\\hline
Useful          &                & X         &                &            &                     \\\hline
Secure          &                &           & X              &            &                     \\\hline
Effective       &                &           & X              &            &                     \\\hline
Correct         & X              &           &                &            &                     \\\hline

\textbf{Useful} indicates the adaptation of the organisational, work related, and technical surroundings. This is important for the meal planner system to fulfil, since the organisational surroundings indicates that the user has to be able to organise the meals correctly.

\textbf{Secure} indicates if the system is secure against unauthorized accessibility. This is less important in the meal planner system, since the system does not contain sensitive personal information.

\textbf{Effective} indicates the economical usage of the technical platform facilities. This is marked less important, as today's smartphones are capable of supporting the requirements needed for this system.

\textbf{Correct} indicates the level of fulfilment of the formulated requirements. The correctness of the meal planner system is very important, as it is needed to live up to requirements found in the analysis part, for the system to be stable.

\textbf{Reliable} indicates the fulfilment of the required precision when functions are executed. The reliability is less important for the meal planner system, as functions can work a little different than stated, as long as the user gets a usable result.

\textbf{Maintenance} indicates the cost of finding and correcting errors in the system. The maintenance of the meal planner system is important, as errors will be made throughout the project. Therefore it is important that errors can be corrected, for the system to work properly.

\textbf{Testable} indicates the cost of securing that the system fulfils the requirements. It is important for the meal planner system to be testable, as testing is part of the waterfall method, and also a good way for the system to be maintainable which is important to the system.

\textbf{Flexible} indicates the cost of changing the system once it has been taken into use. Flexibility is important for the meal planner system, since changes and updates could be needed, in order to maintain the program in the future either because new functionality, or updates.

\textbf{Understandable} indicates the effort to make sure that the system can be understood in the context. Understandability is less important to the meal planner system, as the system is not planned for other developers to work on, and will not be used in a larger context.

\textbf{Reusable} indicates the possibility to reuse parts of the system in similar systems. Reuse is irrelevant as the system is not planned to be used in relation with other systems.

\textbf{Movable} indicates the cost of moving the system to another technical platform. For the meal planner system it is irrelevant to consider the movability, as the system is not planned to be moved to other technical platforms than smartphones and tablets.

\textbf{Integrable} indicates the cost of connecting the system to other systems. Integrability is less important for the meal planner system, because the system will probably not be connected to other systems, unless APIs are going to be included.
