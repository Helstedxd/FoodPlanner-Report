\section{Context}
In this section we look at the context in which certain activities are performed
\subsection{Physical environment}
Having the program on a device set some limitations, as the user will have to interact with the program, during given situations
\begin{itemize}
\item While shopping one hand must be free, to check of items that has been put in the basket, and to see what else must be bought
\item While cooking, an ingredients list could be revisited, or a cooking guide will have to be followed, with greasy hands this kind of interaction will be difficult.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Social context}
\begin{itemize}
\item If more than one person share the same food plan, they must both have access to the program, and if it is handled on their personal devises, some synchronizing is necessary.
\end{itemize}
%\subsection{organizational context}
\fxnote{According to DEB there is also an organizational context, but i can't fit it into this context.}
