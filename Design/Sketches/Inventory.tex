\section{Inventory}

In this section the sketch of the inventory screen is going to be described. The functionality is going to be described as well as the design principles used in the design process. The sketch consists of 3 sketches of the screen, describing 3 different states of the inventory screen as can be seen in figure \ref{FinalInventorySketch}. The first screen from the left, shows the screen when no action has been taken. The second screen from the left shows an expanded ingredient. The third screen from the left shows the screen when the user is searching for something.
