\section{Entity Framework}\label{EntityFrameworkSection}
Entity Framework is a object-relational mapper, part of ADO.NET which are the data-access component of the .NET Framework. 

Entity Framework allows developers to access and work with data as objects and properties.
A conceptual Entity-relationship model is mapped to a datastore schema model. By using the Entity Data Model, the Entity Framework allows data to be treated as entities independently of their underlying datastore representations.
This means that instead of manually writing SQL queries, the developer can rely on the object oriented LINQ syntax as well as lambda expressions, directly from any of the .NET programming language\Cref{EntityFramework}.
