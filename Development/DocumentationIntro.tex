\chapter{Documentation}
This chapter will first document the pages of the program. These pages have been programmed using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), which is a part of the .NET framework. WPF is developed by Microsoft and uses eXtensible Application Markup Language (XAML), which is based on XML, to create the user interface of an application. WPF is well suited for applications which uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) structure because it only deals with the view of an application. The program developed in this project is meant to be a smartphone application. The user interface therefore has a static size resembling a smartphone screen and the interface elements are programmed to look and work as they would on a smartphone. The chapter will then continue to document custom user controls in the program. User controls are used because they make it possible to define the control and behaviour of user interface elements, that can be reused throughout the program.
