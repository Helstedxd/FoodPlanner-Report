\chapter{Development Summary}
The system consists of  different pages, which are explained in \cref{PagesLabel}. Furthermore the system is structured, using the MVVM pattern which means that all the pages have View and ViewModel classes which separates the relevant code, and allows synchronisation through databinding.
A special Navigator class explained in \cref{NavigatorLabel}, is used to allow navigation between the pages. The navigations are implemented as controls in a custom UserControl, explained in \cref{ssc:navBar}. Another UserControl was created to allow selecting ingredients from the database by auto-completing search phrases, the UserControl can be found in \cref{sec:AutoComplete}.
Usability testing, explained in \cref{ch:testing}, have been conducted on the system, to find usability problems, which are divided into three categories: critical, serious, and cosmetic, which indicates the importance of having to solve these problems.
