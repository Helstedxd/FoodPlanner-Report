\section{Activities}
To see, in which context the program will be used, we first look at the activities associated with using the program. The activities have been split into  two, what happens inside, and outside of the home.

In the home:
\begin{itemize}
\item The program will be used to manage the food supply, by;
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Viewing a list of the stored groceries\fxnote{Dette punkt kunne også være udenfor hjemmet (har jeg allerede ddet her derhjemme?), måske der skulle være en tredje del med de punkter som ikke ndvendigvis hører til hjemme/ikke hjemme}
		\item Updating the list, by adding or removing groceries that could have been used, or groceries that has gone bad
		\item Create a shopping list of the groceries needed for the planned meals
		\item Search for recipes
		\item Add new or modified recipes
	\end{itemize}
	Furthermore it should be in the home that settings are set, which could be groceries you want to ignore, because;
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You do not like them
		\item You are allergic
		\item The grocery is not associated with a certain diet
	\end{itemize}
	Certain recipes will require the use of certain kitchen tools, therefore you would want to;
	\begin{itemize}
		\item View what tools are needed
		\item Be able to check if you have the kitchen tools
		\item Associate kitchen tools with a specific recipe
	\end{itemize}
	\item While cooking the meal, you would want to follow a recipe while cooking, which mean you might have to interact with the program during the cooking.
\end{itemize}

Outside the home:
\begin{itemize}
\item While shopping for groceries, it is necessary to keep track of the shopping list, to see what should be bought.
\item If a new recipe is wanted while on the fly, changes to the shopping list must be done.
\end{itemize}
