\subsection{Method used in the report}
The report is an anthropological study of how food waste occurs and how it is experienced by the consumers. The study is based on qualitative data collected from 6 different households. These households are all different from one another e.g. they live in different geographical locations. The data is used to examine the activity patterns and motivation of the participants. The information is found by using observations e.g. watching the users cook, shop or eat.
