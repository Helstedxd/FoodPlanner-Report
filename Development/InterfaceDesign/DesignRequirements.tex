\section{Design Requirements}

When analysing the interviews and the scenarios, some design requirements will be discovered. In this section these requirements will be presented and described, which will provide a base for the design of the interface.

Not planning far ahead is one of the requirements that need to be considered in the design. This would require a easy way to distinguish between days, and only needing to select 1 day at a time.
Some people though, liked to plan

Something that was found as a problem, was that some interview participants didn't consider what groceries they had at home when they went grocery shopping. This means that a requirement would be the ability to keep track of your inventory when shopping. The users should not only be able to see the shopping list, but should also easily access the inventory list.
