\section{Conceptional scenarios}

In this section the conceptional scenarios will be described. 2 conceptional scenarios have been identified based on the user stories, and from the conceptional scenarios, concrete scenarios can be made.

\subsection{Conceptional scenario A} \label{ConceptionalScenarioA}
This person will only plan what is going to be eaten at the day that the cooking will be done. Future meals is not planned, and leftovers are not calculated into the recipe when cooking.
Shopping is therefore also based on what is being eaten the day, and also on the feel basis for what is needed in the home. The person does not use a shopping list, but remembers what is needed.

\subsection{Conceptional scenario B} \label{ConceptionalScenarioB}
This person will choose a number of days, and plan for these, so it is known what is going to be eaten for the specific number of days. The shopping does therefore not have to happen as often as in conceptional scenario A, and the shopping is based on the planned meals, and a shopping list is used to know which groceries to buy.
