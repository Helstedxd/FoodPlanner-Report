\chapter{Development Summary}
The program consists of a window with a frame control, used for displaying the different pages the program constists of.

The program is structured using the MVVM pattern which means that all the pages has a View and ViewModel class which seperates the relevant code, and allows syncronization through databinding.

A special Navigator class is used to allow navigation from both View and ViewModels.

A custom user control was created to allow selecting ingridients from the database by autocompleting search phrases.

The program has usability problems that can be solved. These problems are divided into all the three categories, critical, serious, and cosmetic. The problems are equally divided into the three categories, so some of the problems are important to fix if the program was to be released to the public.
