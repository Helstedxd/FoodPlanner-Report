\chapter{Problem Statement}
It is a problem that food is going to waste.
This is a consequence of bad planning when people are shopping for their upcoming week, and because the consumers want fresh groceries.
Miscalculations are bound to happen if the one doing the shopping is part of a bigger group, such as a family.
Shopping is also time consuming if people want their groceries at a low price.
It can be hard to balance the price and time if the cheap stores are far away, or if the consumer is unaware of discounts.
It becomes extra time consuming if the shoppers have special food diets or preferences.
Maintaining a low food waste level can also add to the difficulty of planning the day, but using all of the ingredients and keeping track of what is in the inventory, makes it easier to maintain a low food waste level.
Users who live alone also find that they have a large food waste, and have a higher cost per meal than users who live and eat together with others.

The problems that were found can be summed up to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Too much food is being wasted.
    \item Miscalculations happen when more people live and eat together.
    \item Shopping is time consuming.
    \item Diets are hard to take into consideration.
    \item Consumers living alone have the most food waste per person.
    \item Consumers living alone have a higher cost per meal, that people living with others.
\end{itemize}
