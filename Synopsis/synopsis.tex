This report will focus on food waste. It will discuss the causes of the problem and then suggest a software solution. The report will first discuss the problem with a focus on the causes and possibly solutions to these. This general view will then be used to create a problem statement for the software solution to solve. Afterwards the architecture and interaction design of the solution will be formulated. The architecture is considered with defining the architectural design. The interaction design defines a design language which is a standard of the solutions interaction design. The architectural and interaction design are then used as a basis for the actual solution program. This program is the product of the report. The last part of the report concludes and sets the future guidelines for the program.
