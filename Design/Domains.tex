\section{Domains}
Domains are important to look at to be able to make the best possible design for the interface of the system. Domain is defined as the different aspects of the program, and both large and small domains will be described.

\subsection{Planning}
Planning is the largest domain of the project, as the software developed is focused on planning meals and a creating a shopping list. Furthermore is planning the primary aspect of the project, as the analysis has concluded that food waste can be reduced by planning meals ahead.

\subsection{Grocery shopping}
Grocery shopping is one of the small domains, as the shopping itself is not something that the software takes into consideration. BY having the software generate a shopping list, for the user to follow, impulse shopping will be reduced, as concluded in the analysis.

\subsection{Cooking}
Cooking is also a small domain. The software gives the user a recipe, where in the quantity of needed ingredients can be changed depending on how many persons the meal will be prepared for.

\subsection{Food inventory administration}
The last domain of the project is food inventory administration. The software is keeping track of the users inventory, so the user can have an easy overview of what is present in the home, but also to be able to calculate that needs to be bought to be able to cook the recipes that are on the meal plan.
