The first section of this chapter formulates different concrete scenarios. These concrete scenarios are more concrete and detailed versions of the different situations presented in the conceptual scenarios section \cref{conceptualScenarios}. The concrete scenarios are used to create paper prototypes. The paper prototypes are created by using the envisionment, prototyping and evaluation processes from the Scenario-based design method.
