\section{Context}
In this section we look at the context in which certain activities are performed. The examined contexts are the physical environment, and the social context.

\subsection{Physical environment}
Using the program in different locations will have different impact on the user experience. Having the program on a device will set some limitations, as the user will have to interact with the program, during different situations.
\begin{itemize}
\item When a user is at home, there is time to update the foodplan and look through different recipes.
\item While shopping, one hand must be free, to check which items that has been put in the basket, and what else must be bought.
\item While cooking at home, an ingredients list could be revisited, or a cooking guide will have to be followed, with greasy hands this kind of interaction will be difficult.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Social context}
The program can be used in different social context.
\begin{itemize}
\item If more than one person share the same food plan, they must both have access to the program, and if it is handled on their personal devices, synchronization is necessary.'
\item The program can be used by only one person nd on one device only, therefore synchronization might be a nuisance instead of a trait for this type of user.
\end{itemize}
