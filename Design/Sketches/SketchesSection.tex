\subsection{Paper Prototyping}\label{Sketches}
This section will include the processes of envisionment, evaluation and prototyping. The prototype is a paper prototype which means it consist of paper sketches depicting how the visual appearance of the program will be made. These sketches are fundamental ideas for the programs design but the design will most likely change during the development phase.

The navigation between the different windows of the program is done by using a bar in the bottom of the screen. This bar is always visible making it possible for the user to quickly select any of the main screens to navigate to. The bar is shown \cref{NavigationBarSketch}.

\subsubsection{Navigation bar}
The navigation bar is placed in the bottom of the screen. The bar has to be readable and its size is therefore quite dynamic as long as the readable requirement is satisfied. Depending on the screen size the navigation bar can fill up a large area of the screen. It has therefore been chosen that the bar will collapse downwards. When the bar is collapsed a line will be displayed at the bottom which the user can press on and the navigation bar will expand upwards.

The navigation bar itself consist of the five following buttons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Meal plan
    \item Recipe
    \item Shopping list
    \item Inventory
    \item Settings
\end{itemize}

Each of the buttons take the user to the screen which it represent, and all of these screens will be described later in this section. The icons displayed on \cref{NavigationBarSketch} are made for the design process, and not necessarily final.
