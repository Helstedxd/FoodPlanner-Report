\section{Concrete Scenarios}
This section will use the process of specifying design constraints on the conceptual scenarios in \cref{conceptualScenarios} and produce a number of concrete scenarios. Each concrete scenario has a PACT overview followed by a detailed scenario description, where notes are marked by a set of parentheses, with roman numerals, e.g. (I), these notes are then listed below the scenario, and explain when in the scenario, different design choices can be made.
